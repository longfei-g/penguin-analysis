# Introduction

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

This is the pengins dataset, but here's a citation for the UCI heart disease @bashir2014ensemble.

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(knitr)
library(here)
library(pkg3.7)

print(getwd())

kable(head(penguins))
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Methods

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.alt="This is for a screen reader and this is a figure of the bill_length_mm on the x axis, and the fillter_lenth_mm on the y, colore by species of penguins", fig.cap="Pengins by fiipper length vs bill length."}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = flipper_length_mm,
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```


```{r penguins-with-lines, echo=TRUE}
#| message=FALSE,
#| warning=FALSE,
#| fig.alt="This is for a screen reader and this is a figure of the bill_length_mm on the x axis, and the fillter_lenth_mm on the y, colore by species of penguins",
#| fig.cap="Pengins by fiipper length vs bill length. Vertical and Horizontal lines represent cutoffs from the function."

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = flipper_length_mm,
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 205) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 45)
```

```{r}
penguins <- penguins %>%
  drop_na() %>% # TODO: make sure you clean this at the top
  mutate(my_predict = map2_chr(bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm, classifier))
```

```{r}
penguins %>%
  count(species, my_predict)
```

# Results

<!--
TODO: this is a html comment
-->
our data has `r nrow(penguins)` rows.
Figure \@ref(fig:penguins-with-lines) has shows where the function will cutoff for the classification.

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
